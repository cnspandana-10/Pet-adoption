# Pet Adoption Management System

This project is a **Pet Adoption Management System** developed using **Python and MySQL**.  
It focuses on storing, managing, and retrieving pet-related information through a relational database.

The project demonstrates **database connectivity, SQL operations, and backend logic** using Python.


##  Project Description

Pet adoption platforms require structured storage and easy retrieval of pet information.  
This project connects a Python application with a MySQL database to manage pet records such as:

- Pet ID  
- Pet name  
- Age  
- Breed  
- Gender  
- Health status  

The system allows interaction with the database using SQL queries executed from Python.


##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- MySQL  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- MySQL Connector / PyMySQL  


##  Features

- MySQL database creation and connection  
- Insertion of pet records into the database  
- Retrieval and display of pet details  
- Basic backend data management using SQL
